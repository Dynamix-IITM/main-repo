I started with reading the paper. It wasn't a long read, but I found the arguments used by the authors to justify different processes to be nonintuitive at first.
Still, I kept reading and went on to try coding up the equations they gave in Python [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UhZfxzaA9NqxaS3s4VMM6kZvpTvhHgGf#scrollTo=11_-y_INcvWP). After my first read, I had the following four questions which I have tried answering below: <br><br>

Q1) How is the existence of atomic clouds justified? Why don't the atoms simply fuse to form molecules?<br><br>
Q2) Why does the decay of atomic clouds go as $AM^2$? Why the squaring?<br><br>
Q3) Same question for decay of molecular clouds- why $SM^n$?<br>
This is as per the experimental [Kennicutt-Schmidt Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennicutt%E2%80%93Schmidt_law). <br><br>
Q4) Why do stellar winds contribute to atomic clouds instead of molecular clouds?<br><br><br>


As for the textbook, since I'd already read upto page 54 for my application (and whatever I learned I had included in my app), I have only summarised the rest below:<br><br>
A map $g$ from a bigger set $X$ to smaller set $B$ can give rise to a sorting of $X$ into $B$, which means that you can sort the elements of $X$ into different compartments such that all elements in one compartment point to the same element in $B$. This is called sorting or stacking. This process makes it easier to find the number of sections for $g$. It just turns out to be the product of the number of elements in each stack. This has a corollary: if even one stack is empty, then there are no sections back from $B$ to $X$ (this agrees with the notion that if a map is into and does not cover all elements in the codomain then it has no sections, the sorting of such maps is called partitioning). <br><br>

I also learned something interesting, that sections always go from smaller to bigger sets and retractions always go from bigger to smaller sets. An isomorphism (map that has both retraction and section) hence can only exist between two sets of the same size. <br><br>

An idempotent endomap, i.e. any map $e: A \rightarrow A$ such that $ee=e$, results in fixed points in the map $A$. In the context of these idempotent endomaps, a fixed point is any element in $A$ which a) points to itself and b) has few other elements pointing to it. This implies that all elements of $A$ point to some or the other fixed point. <br><br>
