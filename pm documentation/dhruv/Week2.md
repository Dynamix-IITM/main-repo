I managed to install Julia, and translate my previous Python code for simulating the dynamics of a stellar system. I have attached the code as a separate file ("StarFormation") in this folder. <br><br>

I have also read upto page 123 of Lawvere, but I'll summarise everything once I'm done with all the theorems.
