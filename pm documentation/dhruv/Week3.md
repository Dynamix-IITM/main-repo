## <ins>The Category of Endomaps of Sets </ins> <br><br>

One thing we must notice till now that each point in a set is identical, we really don't bother distingushing one from another. All that changes when we talk about the endomaps of sets-interesting structure often arises in this context. <br>

This category of endomaps, call it S', what are its objects? And how are maps defined? Let's answer all this below:

For any objects X and Y, $\alpha: X \rightarrow X$ and $\beta: Y \rightarrow Y$ we define a specific map $f$ as follows:<br>

Note that this map is not arbitrary. Since morphisms must "preserve structure", $f$ must satisfy the following:<br><br>

The internal diagram of an object may look like: <br><br>

In the above diagram, the idea is that when we apply $\alpha$ to any point in the set, the "arrow" will point towards another point (as the mapping is an endomap so the source and target elements belong to the same set). So we may observe chains of arrows, cycles, fixed points, etc. It should be noted that if two objects in this category are isomorphic, then the structure is mirrored (same number of  same length cycles, same chains, etc.).
