# Current files

# Resources

- [Link](https://www.overleaf.com/8741692894tmjsbfpfcfvx#5088f9) to overleaf documentation. This link is sensitive so please be careful.

- Modelcollab [frontend](https://modelcollab.web.app/).

# To-Do

- @Aditi, @Avani, @Deena and @Hirithik: Write content. 

- @Dhruv, @Navin, @Siva: Document the code in this directory itself.

- ODE method does not work in modelcollab. Look into it.

- Parse the exported JSON meaningfully.

- Self hosting modelcollab is painful (look into Issue#1 of modelcollab repo). Find a workaround to extract the JSON automatically.
