# Online Meet on 25th June 2024

## Start of the meet:
* People gave comments on Lawvere
* 100 pages is pretty doable when you know most of the concepts beforehand
* Nikhil explained - target to complete reading lawvere by summer, 2 weeks can go into sem if we don't meet target

## What we will do in the next week (In short: Dynamical Systems - numerically - in Julia - FDE, Read Lawvere till 130pg)
* Theory: Learn finite difference method
* Read Task: Read Lawvere till 130pg
* Prog Task: Implement a program in Julia which numerically solves star formation paper, for those who are familiar with numerical methods try to learn about parallelism 

We had a discussion on the physics of cooling of atomic clouds and M^2 factor

Discussion on Vectors, Vector Spaces, functions as vectors
Finite difference method, initial conditions
Julia - has native support for broadcasting and other good frameworks, can parallelize in GPU without adding much code

## We split ourselves into groups:
1. Navin, Siva, Hrithik
2. Deena, Dhruv
3. Aditi, Avani

## Keep in mind:
In the progress reports, add summary of what you have read as well (short notes)
