# MoM’s 2nd July 2024 (week 3):
  - bit weak in the last few pages (nearly everyone is facing problems)
  - Maintain notes for everything you read, post it in that weeks folder
  - Merge everything to the main repo for week 2
  - Put code along with notes, in the week 2 folder; submit rendered code instead of source code
  - Complete the first 200 pages by 14th July. The first offline meet will be conducted after that (tentatively 15th July)
  - Next meet on sunday (7th July) 
  - Work meet: for discussing reading content  (date - wed/thurs)
  - **Create a summary document, recording what you’ve read. You need to show some progress on that by the 7th.** Needs to be complete by 14th.
