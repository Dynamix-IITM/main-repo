# Start of the meet:
* People gave comments on Lawvere
* 100 pages is pretty doable when you know most of the concepts beforehand
* Nikhil explained - target to complete reading lawvere by summer, 2 weeks can go into sem if we don't meet target

# What we will do in the next week: 
# (In short: Dynamical Systems - numerically - in Julia - FDE, Read Lawvere till 130pg)
* Theory: Learn finite difference method
* Task: Implement a program in Julia which numerically solves star formation paper

We had a discussion on the physics of cooling of atomic clouds and M^2 factor

Discussion on Vectors, Vector Spaces, functions as vectors
Finite difference method, initial conditions
Julia - has native support for broadcasting and other good frameworks, can parallelize in GPU without adding much code

# We split ourselves into groups:
1. Navin, Siva, Hrithik
2. Deena, Dhruv
3. Aditi, Avani

# Keep in mind:
In the progress reports, add summary of what you have read as well (short notes)
