#### Attendance : 
 Absent - Dhruv 
### Post Project - Review Meet :
- We need to explain our problem statement properly. Category theory is not a new method of solving differential equations, it just formalises the mathematics behind using petri nets to represent differential equations.
- Composing models is not easier while we use cat. theory -> If we have one model with results and another model without results, when we want to compose them we should find its result from scratch only (Not effectively using the result of one model).
- In PPT, we must avoid redirects and put all in the ppt itself.
  
### Next weeks' tasks :
- Look to COVID19 modelling paper which was sent by Nikhil in the group.
- Coding and Documentations team interchange their tasks now. The old coding team has to explore applied category and dynamical systems say electrical circuits.
- The old documentation team has to do all the corrections told to each in the epidemic paper we made on or before Saturday and later see modelling using Stockflow diagrams in Julia.
