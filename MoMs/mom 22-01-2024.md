### Discussing everyones ideas for future work 
- Deena; gradient descent using category theory 
- Dhruv; QM and chaotic systems 
- Hrithik; CQL, model a dynamical system 
- Siva; formalising electrical circuits using category theory 
- Avani; CQL
- Navin; electrical circuits, do something using a functional language- problem of boolean satisfiability niche problems that can be solved in a functional standpoint. Circuits shouldn't be abstracted, rather the ‘details’ seem to be more important here. 
- Aditi; linguistics and deep learning

- Discussed what the difference between parallelism and concurrency is
- Fisrt few tasks for CQL
    - Setting it up and validating via examples
 
- Finalised sub-topics:
  1. CQL
  2. Electrical Circuits
  3. DL
  4. Linguistucs
  5. Satisfiabilty problem + functional programming 

- *Before next week*: Come up with 2 areas of interest within your topic
