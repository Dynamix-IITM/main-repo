Attendance:
Leads: Ganesh and Nikhil
PMs:
1.	Aditi
2.	Avani
3.	Deenabandhan
4.	Dhruv
5.	Hirithik
6.	Navin
7.	Siva
Objectives: (For the next two weeks)
1.	Start documenting the code and the Category theory part of the paper.
Two groups were made (tentatively):
•	Dhruv, Navin and Siva for documenting the code.
•	Aditi, Avani, Deenabandhan and Hirithik for the category theory part.
Format:
	Goal of the paper/motivation
	Different types of abstracting dynamical system: Stock and flow diagrams, Petri Nets.
	More about petri nets
	Composition 
	Stratification
	Leading to code 
	Conclusion

	Making an interactive model using modelcollab. The idea is that any walker-by can suggest a novel diagram and our code should be able to parse the json file so created and model the required differential equations
Other key points:
1.	PM review on 19th ,20th and 21st of September.
2.	Research Conclave on 19th October.
3.	We can look into other aspects of the paper like petri-net ODE conversions, non-linear dynamical systems.
4.	Being consistent with updating on overleaf.
