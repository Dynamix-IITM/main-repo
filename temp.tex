\section*{Monomorphisms in Category Theory}

\subsection*{Definition}
A morphism $f : A \rightarrow B$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is called a \textbf{monomorphism} (or \textbf{mono}) if for every pair of morphisms $g, h : C \rightarrow A$, the condition $f \circ g = f \circ h$ implies $g = h$.
\newline
In symbols:
\begin{equation*}
\forall g, h : C \rightarrow A, \quad (f \circ g = f \circ h) \implies (g = h)
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{Key Properties of Monomorphisms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Left Cancellative}: Monomorphisms are left cancellative. This means that if $f \circ g = f \circ h$ and $f$ is a monomorphism, then $g = h$.
    \item \textbf{Generalization of Injective Functions}: In the category of sets, a monomorphism corresponds to an injective (one-to-one) function. However, in other categories, the notion of a monomorphism might not coincide with injectivity in the usual sense.
    \item \textbf{Stability Under Composition}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $f : A \rightarrow B$ and $g : B \rightarrow C$ are monomorphisms, then the composition $g \circ f : A \rightarrow C$ is also a monomorphism.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Epimorphisms in Category Theory}

\subsection*{Definition}
A morphism $f : A \rightarrow B$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is called an \textbf{epimorphism} (or \textbf{epi}) if for every pair of morphisms $g, h : B \rightarrow C$, the condition $g \circ f = h \circ f$ implies $g = h$.
\newline
In symbols:
\begin{equation*}
\forall g, h : B \rightarrow C, \quad (g \circ f = h \circ f) \implies (g = h)
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{Key Properties of Epimorphisms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Right Cancellative}: Epimorphisms are right cancellative. This means that if $g \circ f = h \circ f$ and $f$ is an epimorphism, then $g = h$.
    \item \textbf{Generalization of Surjective Functions}: In the category of sets, an epimorphism corresponds to a surjective (onto) function. However, in other categories, the notion of an epimorphism might not coincide with surjectivity in the usual sense.
    \item \textbf{Stability Under Composition}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $f : A \rightarrow B$ and $g : B \rightarrow C$ are epimorphisms, then the composition $g \circ f : A \rightarrow C$ is also an epimorphism.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
